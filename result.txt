    - Started off with: 
        - num_epochs = 10
        - learning rate = 0.0001
        - activation function for output layer is LogSoftmax(dim=1)
dogcatmodel_nn: Test Accuracy = 73% (Original Model)

dogcatmodel2_nn: Test Accuracy = 77%
    - Changed: learning rate = 0.00009

dogcatmodel3_nn: Test Accuracy = 76%
    - Changed: activation function for output layer is Sigmoid()

dogcatmodel4_nn: Test Accuracy = 75%
    - Changed: learning rate = 0.0001

dogcatmodel5_nn: Test Accuracy = 76%
    - Changed: reverted back to Hyperparameters used in dogcatmodel2_nn
